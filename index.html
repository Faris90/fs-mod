        Scrap is a mod designed to make creating Scratch projects a whole lot easier. It's backwards- (and forwards-) compatible with Scratch, too.

        <b>LEGAL THINGS INCOMING</b><br>
        The Scratch Team might pick at you for uploading a project made in Scrap to Scratch, though, since their terms of use denies it to some extent; at least include a disclaimer in your project that it was made in Scrap. But I'm not a lawyer. Go ask an ST member (probably from the more technical team) instead, please?
